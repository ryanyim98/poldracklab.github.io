- The lab’s policy follows the
IJCME recommendations on [Defining the Role of Authors
and
Contributors](http://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html),
which state that authorship should be based on four criteria:
    - Substantial contributions to
    the conception or design of the work; or the acquisition, analysis,
    or interpretation of data for the work; AND
    - Drafting the work or revising
    it critically for important intellectual content; AND
    - Final approval of the version
    to be published; AND
    - Agreement to be accountable
    for all aspects of the work in ensuring that questions related to
    the accuracy or integrity of any part of the work are appropriately
    investigated and resolved.
- Importantly, we view substantial
contributions to data acquisition or analysis alone to be sufficient for
authorship on the primary project manuscript, as long criteria 2-4 are met. For this reason, research
assistants in our lab often end up being coauthors on our publications.
- Criterion \#1 also implies
    that Dr. Poldrack will *not* accept authorship on any work that he
    has not played a substantial role in either designing, analyzing, or
    interpreting.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please do
    not send completed manuscripts with a request for him to be a
    coauthor.
- The sharing of data is
not considered to be sufficient on its own to warrant authorship;
instead, credit should be given through citation of a data descriptor
and/or dataset DOI.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>However,
authorship is appropriate in cases where the dataset owner provides
substantial input into the research, or when required by the data use
agreement.

## Affiliation

- The listed affiliation should
include any institutions where one was affiliated while completing the
work.   
    - Any work completed at
    Stanford should include the Stanford affiliation, even if the
    individual has left Stanford.
    - Work completed prior to
    joining Stanford but published after joining the lab does not need
    to include the Stanford affiliation, but it may be included (along
    with the institution where the work was completed) if work was done
    on the paper after joining the lab.
